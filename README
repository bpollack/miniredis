miniredis is an extremely minimal server that supports exactly enough redis
to power splined.  It's currently used in the development version of the
Kiln backend when Kiln runs on Windows computers.  While I'm happy to accept
patches making this closer to a real Redis alternative, I currently have
no plans to implement the entire Redis suite.
